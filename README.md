i like building stuff and this page is where i put it all

i enjoy learning new things, particularly things that help me improve my projects (or just stuff that's just fun)

i'm very active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Zyplos). i post updates on whatever it is i'm working on at the moment and like showing off design stuff on there from time to time. you can contact me on there if you'd like.

i like spending my time building stuff. in fact, maybe i'm building something right now:
